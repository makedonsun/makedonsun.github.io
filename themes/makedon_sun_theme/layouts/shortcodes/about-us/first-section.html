      We are a relatively new, family-owned winery and distillery from
      Valandovo, the warmest region in Macedonia. Our name – MAKEDON SUN – was
      inspired by the strong and radiant Macedonian sun, a true symbol of our
      land and heritage. Guided by tradition, passion, and innovation, we craft
      authentic wines, spirits, and unique products made from Japanese apples,
      grown in one of the most fertile and sun-kissed areas of the country.
      Every drop reflects the power of nature and the spirit of Macedonia.
