          <p class="pt-5">
            Persimmon (Diospyros kaki), often called the Japanese apple, is not
            only delicious but also packed with valuable nutrients. Rich in
            vitamins A, C, and E, as well as antioxidants, potassium, and
            dietary fiber, this fruit supports the immune system, promotes
            healthy digestion, and helps protect the body from oxidative stress.

            Its high content of beta-carotene contributes to healthy vision and
            radiant skin, while the natural antioxidants support heart health
            and overall vitality. Low in fat and cholesterol-free, persimmon is
            considered a true superfruit â€“ a perfect balance of taste and
            wellness in every bite.
