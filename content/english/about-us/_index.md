About Us – MAKEDON SUN

MAKEDON SUN is a winery and distillery located in the heart of the Valandovo region – one of the most fertile and sun-kissed areas in North Macedonia. Our mission is simple: to craft natural, authentic, and high-quality wines, brandies, mastika, and vinegar made from persimmon (Diospyros kaki) – a rare fruit with a distinctive taste and impressive health benefits.

We are proud to be the first producers in Europe to create alcoholic beverages and vinegar exclusively from persimmon, using traditional methods, hand-selected fruit, and natural fermentation – with no additives, no preservatives, and no compromise.

Our approach combines:

🌿 100% natural ingredients

☀️ Macedonian sun and soil

🍷 Small-batch handcrafted production

✅ Strict quality control and unique flavor

With MAKEDON SUN, you're getting more than a drink – you're tasting a story of land, tradition, and innovation. Every drop carries the warmth of the Macedonian sun, the flavors of Valandovo, and the dedication of our team.

MAKEDON SUN – Naturally Distinctive.
